<strong style="color:#ff0000;">Q: How to Find a middle element in a link list in minimum time?</strong>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ans</span>: We must have to know the end point of the link list to know the middle element. If we run fist loop just to get the whole length and then second loop to get middle element it would be a time consuming task. Instead we can put one pointer to be traversing one element at a time, while the second pointer moves 2 elements at a time. This way when the second pointer reaches the end, the first pointer will be at the middle.
